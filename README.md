* Decide to implement a config file, this way make it easier if we need to change any config
* Implemented the request object but felt that a response object was needed to treat the results
* After that decided to add objects to represent the app info and the offer info, this way would be easier to user the response in the view
* Then made a home controller to render the first layout, but decided to rename it as offers controller
* Used the objects I already constructed in the controller to show in the view
